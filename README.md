# TFC

This is a fictional web application of a gym website.<br>

I publish this project here as a token for my learning django rest framework and react (also as my professor encouraged us to make our projects public).<br>

## usage

run in your command prompt<br>
```
./startup.sh
./run.sh
```

After them some processes will be running on background of your computer including both frontend and backend. <br>
 So if you want to stop them, you have to check process ids for this project using 
 ```ps
 ```
  command and 
 ```
 kill -9 (pid)
 ```
 for each pid related to the project.
